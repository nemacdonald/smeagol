# SMEAGOL

**Welcome to the SMEAGOL documentation!**

For instructions on installing an environment and SMEAGOL check out the {ref}`Install` section for further information.

```{caution} SMEAGOL documentation is under construction!
```

SMEAGOL currently uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) for documentation.
Some sample book documentation, such as {ref}`Markdown`, is still used in this repository and will be updated at a future date.
